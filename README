memcached module for PHP
------------------------
This module doesn't require any libraries or headers to be built.
But you'll need memcached to use it =)

The memcached website is at:
    http://www.danga.com/memcached/

You will probably need libevent to install memcached:
You can download it here: http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
